## Rules for myself when attending zoom sessions

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- When on the zoom class. Only one terminal for note taking and another web browser for the zoom session. No other tabs and no distractions. (1)

- zoom view: Standard speaker - I only need see the instructor talking. Not other students. Viewing other students can be a distraction.

- Keep web camera and mic off until I need to use it. It helps to save on bandwidth.

</div>

1. I refuse to get the zoom application. I would prefer to attend zoom session via web browser. [YouTube link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gNSYB052yA) and [YouTube link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgoto6kAgg) for informative videos on why not to use zoom. 

## Using YouTube as a resouce

I view YouTube as a free online video storage. Therefore I will post my video recordings of the course to YouTube (But will unlist the videos). The whole playlist can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVreLowe7hDXOrbzXCJ9XSmrn5zkGOKsL)
